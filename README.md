# Data Analyst Portfolio Project
Hello, My Name is Zain and this is my Git Hub channel. Here I am building my portfolio
Project that I learn from expert like AlexTheAnalyst, Luke Barousse, Dhaval Patel and 
other famous youtube channels.
This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects I create.
Please feel free to take these and run with them. Make them your own and find you own insights
I really do hope this is helpful and helps you in your future endeavour! 😊
